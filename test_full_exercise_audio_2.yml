      Do you ever find yourself hanging out with someone, taking on an extra task, or doing something for someone else just because you don’t have the heart to say no? 

      Today we invite you to take time out to listen to your needs and look for where you can say no. Remember that every time you say yes to something you don’t really want to do, you have less time for what you do find more meaningful. Saying no, then, protects both your time and energy—and creates space for what really matters. 

      Of course, being there for others and helping out where possible can be enriching for all involved. But remember, too, that it’s just as important to take into consideration your own needs and limits. After all, you can only be there for others over the long term if you take good care of yourself.

      And saying no doesn't have to be complicated or unfriendly. You don't need a lot of explanation—a clear, respectful no is enough. Something like:
  - type: dialogue
    position: right
    content: That's sweet of you, but I can’t make it work today.
  - type: text
    content: or
  - type: dialogue
    position: right
    content: I'm sorry but I don’t have the time in my schedule to help out today.
  - type: text
    content: Your needs are just as important as those of others. Have the courage to say no—the more often you practice it, the easier it’ll become. You got this!
